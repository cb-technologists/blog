  title: "Secure CloudBees Core on Kubernetes"
  description: "If security wasn't important to you then you probably wouldn't be using CloudBees Core. Security for software delivery is a [key feature of CloudBees Core](https://go.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-core/cloud-secure-guide/) and even though CloudBees Core offers myriad critical security features OOTB there are other Kubernetes features and tools you can take advantage of to make it even more secure. This series will explore best practices around reducing the attack surface of malicious or accidental access that may put your CloudBees Core v2 installation on Kubernetes at risk. From credentials management to leveraging native security features of Kubernetes itself, the posts in this series will cover topics that will make your CloudBees Core cluster on Kubernetes more secure."
