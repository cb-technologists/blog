We may know [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io) as a new pure CI/CD cloud native implementation different than [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io). It is based on the use of Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRD's) to experience a seamless execution of CI/CD pipelines. This happens by leveraging the power of Kubernetes in terms of scalability, infrastructure abstraction and velocity.

The new main approach of Jenkins X is about a serverless experience, because there is no more traditional Jenkins engine running. So, it relies on a CI/CD pipeline engine that can run on any standard Kubernetes deployment. This engine is the [Tekton CD project ](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline), a former Google project that is also - like Jenkins X - part of the [Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation/).

In this post, we are showing the power of Tekton as a decoupled CI/CD pipeline engine execution. But more important, why an orchestration pipeline platform is practically required to design, configure and run your pipelines for the whole Software Delivery process. This orchestration platform is Jenkins X.

## The Tekton base

Why then Tekton is a cool CI/CD engine?

First of all, Tekton is built on and for Kubernetes. This means that containers are the building blocks of any pipeline definition and execution. Kubernetes orchestrates the container's magic. One step, one container. But it's more than that:

- Everything is decoupled. So for example, a group of steps, or any pipeline resource can be shared and reused accross different pipeline executions.
- Kubernetes is the platform, meaning that pipelines can be deployed and executed basically anywhere.
- Sequential execution of `Tasks` defines a `Pipeline`. So creating a pipeline conceptually is as easy as defining the order of the tasks that we want to run and that may be already deployed in our Kubernetes cluster.
- Any task can be run by instantiating it from a parametrized `TaskRun`. Because every previous task can be parametrized, reusing them is just a matter of calling the right task with a specific parameter. Again, decoupling and reusing.
- Pipelines usually consume different resources like code, containers, files, etc. So Tekton uses `PipelineResources` as inputs and outputs between tasks to execute the pipeline workflow. That means that pipeline resources can be shared between pipelines in a descriptive way.
- Every pipeline component is a CRD, so pipeline execution is a matter of containers orchestration, something that Kubernetes does really well and pretty fast. It is reliable, stable, scalable and performant.

Let's try to understand Tekton pipelines decoupled architecture in the following diagram :
![Tekton Pipeline Architecture](/img/tekton-jx-orchestration/TektonPipeline_Arch.png)

In terms of scalability, it's a nice way to isolate objects that can be reused easily, right?

## Decoupling CI/CD is good, but...

Tekton then is about the power of a decoupled CI/CD engine, which has many advantages. But no one said that defining decoupled CI/CD pipelines was an easy task. It can be complex from a conceptual point of view if you don't change your mindset. Traditionally, we've been defining pipelines as different stages with their current steps to be executed. So, everything is only about how to orchestrate stages as sequential or parallel tasks, configuring parameters or conditions into the pipeline. Let's say that CI/CD has a monolithic mindset to configure and define pipelines.

If we start designing reusable components, then the resources, the pipeline flow, the execution parametrization and then feeding all components back and forth... This can be messy and error prone till having the complete decoupled pipeline map configured.

## An orchestration engine to manage pipelines

We might think about how to orchestrate this. Let's then think about three decoupling best practices for pipelines in containerized ecosystems:

- The CI/CD execution  must be flexible, reusable and decoupled.
- The pipeline orchestration must be manageable, understandable and easy to deploy.
- Resources configuration for pipeline components needs to be standardized and easy to manage.

CI/CD in not only about designing automation pipelines to deliver software. It is also about managing and providing all resources required for automation execution. In Kubernetes we will need to deal also with different objects like `Secrets`, `ServiceAccounts`, `PersistentVolumes`, `ConfigMaps`, `Ingress`, etc.

To focus on CI/CD pipelines, resources management should be an easy task.

## An example to understand Tekton and Jenkins X orchestration

We are using an example of building an application by defining and running CI/CD pipelines with standalone Tekton. Then, we are taking the same application to see how Jenkins X pipelines, using Tekton, generate similar objects but from a different focus. It will show how pipeline orchestration capabilities are applied to a decoupled CI/CD pipeline engine, no matter how I need to deal with platform or infrastructure resources.

To do that we are using a well known [Spring Petclinic example](https://projects.spring.io/spring-petclinic/) Spring Boot application. And let's use a repo that is using traditional Jenkins pipeline to build the application, create a Docker container and deploy into Kubernetes cluster.

In my traditional Jenkins example I use two pipelines in fact that are automated using [CloudBees Core Cross Team Collaboration](https://go.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-core/cloud-admin-guide/cross-team-collaboration/) feature:

- [Repo with a Jenkins pipeline to build](https://github.com/dcanadillas/petclinic-kaniko) the app, the Docker container and push it into Docker Registry
- A simple [Jenkins pipeline repo to deploy](https://github.com/dcanadillas/petclinic-kaniko-deploy) the previous container published

But in our case, we are putting those pipeline steps into one pipeline to do the build and deploy. First with a "pure Tekton" pipeline definition, and later using Jenkins X serverless pipelines.

### The pure Tekton way

So let's try to configure and execute the pipeline from a pure Tekton pipeline point of view. That means:

- Creating [`PipelineResources`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/resources.md) that are going to be used by `Tasks`
- Defining and creating [`Tasks`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/tasks.md) that contain the steps to be executed in the `Pipeline`
- Defining and creating the [`Pipeline`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/pipelines.md) that orchestrates the execution of `Tasks` with `Resources`
- Creating the [`PipelineRun`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/pipelineruns.md)
- Installing required Kubernetes resources, like `Secrets`, `ServiceAccounts` or permissions, in order to execute required steps within right containers (e.g. secrets used by Kaniko builder)

I already created a [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/dcanadillas/petclinic-tekton) with all YAML files needed (except secrets, which are explained in the `README` file). But let's go through them.

We can create a YAML file with all `Tasks` objects and the `Pipeline` definition. We can call this file `petclinic-pipeline.yaml`:

```yaml

apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1

      resources:
        inputs:

            resource: source-repo
        outputs:

            resource: source-repo
    - name: petclinic-kaniko
      taskRef:
        name: build-kaniko
      resources:
        inputs:
          - name: workspace
            resource: source-repo
            from: 
              - petclinic-maven
        outputs:
          - name: dockerImage
            resource: docker-container
    - name: petclinic-deploy
      taskRef:
        name: deploy-kubectl
      runAfter:
        - petclinic-kaniko
      resources:
        inputs:
          - name: workspacedeploy
            resource: deploy-repo
      params:
        - name: deployFile
          value: test-deploy-secret.yaml
```

Then we can define also a file `pipeline-resources.yaml` with all required `PipelineResources` objects needed:
```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineResource
metadata:
  name: petclinic-git
spec:
  type: git
  params:
    - name: url
      value: https://github.com/dcanadillas/petclinic-kaniko.git
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineResource
metadata:
  name: petclinic-image
spec:
  type: image
  params:
    - name: url
      value: eu.gcr.io/emea-sa-demo/petclinic-kaniko:latest
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineResource
metadata:
  name: petclinic-deploy
spec:
  type: git
  params:
    - name: url
      value: https://github.com/dcanadillas/petclinic-kaniko-deploy.git
```

As `PipelineResources` we are using the two GitHub repositories from the original repos as inputs (one for the application and the other for deployment definitions), and one container image as output to be built.

Next, let's define the `PipelineRun`, that executes and instantiate the pipeline, in a file `petclinic-run.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: petclinic-pipelinerun
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: petclinic-pipeline
  serviceAccount: 'default'
  serviceAccounts:
    - taskName: petclinic-deploy
      serviceAccount: tekton-deployment
  resources:
  - name: source-repo
    resourceRef:
      name: petclinic-git
  - name: docker-container
    resourceRef:
      name: petclinic-image
  - name: deploy-repo
    resourceRef:
      name: petclinic-deploy
```

In the `PipelineRun` object is important to understand that is intended in the way of defining the specific running instance of a deployed pipeline. It's the right place to assign running input/output parameter values, specify `serviceAccounts` to be used, or referencing the right `PipelieResources` to be used.

Once we have the YAML definitions, it's only a matter of Kubernetes deployment of the Tekton CRD objects. We can use then `kubectl` command line tool to deploy first the two YAML files with `PipelineResources`, `Tasks` and `Pipeline`:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f petclinic-resources.yaml,petclinic-pipeline.yaml
pipelineresource.tekton.dev/petclinic-git created
pipelineresource.tekton.dev/petclinic-image created
pipelineresource.tekton.dev/petclinic-deploy created
task.tekton.dev/build-maven created
task.tekton.dev/build-kaniko created
task.tekton.dev/deploy-kubectl created
pipeline.tekton.dev/petclinic-pipeline created
```

We can see then the objects already deployed, as `CRDs` objects.

```bash
$ kubectl get tasks,pipelines,pipelineresources
NAME                             AGE
task.tekton.dev/build-kaniko     2s
task.tekton.dev/build-maven      2s
task.tekton.dev/deploy-kubectl   2s

NAME                                     AGE
pipeline.tekton.dev/petclinic-pipeline   2s

NAME                                           AGE

pipelineresource.tekton.dev/petclinic-git      2s
pipelineresource.tekton.dev/petclinic-image    2s
```

And we can check the pipeline to be executed:

```bash
$ kubectl describe pipeline.tekton.dev/petclinic-pipeline

Namespace:    tekton-pipelines
Labels:       <none>

`Pipeline` object is going to execute in order the tasks already existing in K8s cluster: `build-maven`, `build-kaniko` and `deploy-kubectl`. And for that we are setting as inputs and outputs the different `PipelineResources`. 

But we are using some resources expected in the cluster that are not created at pipeline definition, like `Secrets` for pushing into private Docker Registry (GCR in my case), `ServiceAccount`, `Roles` and `RoleBindings` to deploy in Kubernetes with the specific permissions. I am not focusing on doing this at this post, but you can read how to do it in my [original repo documentation](https://github.com/dcanadillas/petclinic-tekton/blob/master/README.md#configuration-requirements).

Now, running the pipeline is just about deploying the `PipelineRun` definition in our `pipeline-run.yaml` file:

```bash
kubectl apply -f petclinic-run.yaml
```

A Tekton `CRD` is then created to run the pipeline.

```
pipelinerun.tekton.dev/petclinic-pipelinerun created
```

Different things are going to happen in this case:

- The `PipelineRun` is going to create a `TaskRun` per `Task`. Than means that every stage of the pipeline is going to be executed within the `Task` definition already deployed, depending on the `Pipeline` flow created
- Every `TaskRun` is going to be executed in a Kubernetes `Pod`, using the containers specified in the different `Steps` in `Tasks`. Remember about Tekton: One step. One container.
- `PipelineResources` are just "consumed or produced" by `Tasks` depending on the parameters used during `TaskRuns` 
- Different `ServiceAccounts` are going to be used for `Tasks` depending on the definition of the `PipelineRun` (it makes sense that different roles are needed for different tasks)

So, if we take a look about our execution after the complete run:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                                      READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

petclinic-pipelinerun-petclinic-maven-9gnpf-pod-fa757f    0/5     Completed   0          4m
tekton-pipelines-controller-6b565f9859-knqsb              1/1     Running     0          8h
tekton-pipelines-webhook-7f47c995cd-db2rv                 1/1     Running     0          8h
```

And we can check that `TaskRuns` where created:

```bash
$ kubectl get taskruns
NAME                                           SUCCEEDED   REASON      STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME

petclinic-pipelinerun-petclinic-maven-9gnpf    True        Succeeded   2h          2h
```

Looking inside at one of them we can see the execution status and completion:

```bash
$ kubectl describe taskrun/petclinic-pipelinerun-petclinic-kaniko-s4nnw

Finally, the application should have been deployed. Let's check:

We then confirmed that this kind of pipeline definition and execution in Kubernetes can be extremely powerful in terms of reusability and extensibility. We've just deployed tasks definitions, ordering and resources descriptions, and running specification. Everything is about playing with Cloud Native resources to deal with CI/CD pipeline objects and executions.

But let's face it. This is not a very easy way of executing pipelines. Powerful, but complex from a conceptual pipeline design.

### Playing with Jenkins X Serverless Pipelines

We can think about orchestrating the previous application pipeline with Tekton to simplify it's usage and make it "manageable". Jenkins X is a very good solution to do that, because:

- Jenkins X [build packs](https://jenkins-x.io/architecture/build-packs/) give you pre-set pipelines (among other things) for your applications. You can then start with a prepared and curated conceptual design that is easy to manage.
- Jenkins X is not a pipeline engine, it's a CI/CD solution. So all resources like Git repos, users, `serviceAccounts`, environment `namespaces`, `ingress` rules, Docker Registry credentials, etc. are already configured to be able to orchestrate pipeline execution.
- Configuring or extending pipeline definitions is just a matter of defining the flow of stages with their steps/containers to be executed. And Tekton is used automatically to decouple run definition and execution. Monolithic abstraction, decoupled execution. 
- [Jenkins X Pipelines](https://jenkins-x.io/architecture/jenkins-x-pipelines/) simplify any pipeline process to develop features, release or promote/deploy your code through environments.

To understand what we mean about Tekton orchestration, let's try to simulate the same tasks and steps in our previous Tekton example, but defining a basic Jenkins X serverless pipeline without using build packs.

*NOTE: Don't think about this as a standard way to work with Jenkins X. We are showing first a standalone `jenkins-x.yml` pipeline to demonstrate how Tekton objects are created and orchestrated automatically by Jenkins X.*

Jenkins X cluster creation and installation it's just a matter of minutes. So, to start executing pipelines we'll start to deploy a Jenkins X cluster from scracth in GKE after [installing the Jenkins X CLI](https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/install/) (showing parameters instead of values):

```bash
jx create cluster gke \
--cluster-name ${JX_CLUSTER} \
--default-admin-password ${MYPWD} \
--environment-git-owner ${GH_ORG} \
--min-num-nodes 3 --max-num-nodes 5 \
--machine-type n1-standard-2 \
--project-id ${GCP_PROJECT} --zone europe-west1-c \
--default-environment-prefix ${JX_CLUSTER} \
--git-provider-kind github \
--git-username ${GH_USER} \
--git-api-token ${GH_APITOKEN} \
--tekton \
--no-tiller \
-b
```

Once having the Jenkins X installation (serverless mode with [Prow](https://jenkins-x.io/architecture/prow/) and Tekton), you can check that Tekton `CRDs` are already there:

```bash
$ kubectl get crd
NAME                                           CREATED AT
[...]
pipelineresources.tekton.dev                   2019-07-10T11:38:50Z

tasks.tekton.dev                               2019-07-10T11:38:50Z
[...]
```

Right now, let's try to simulate the Tekton pipeline that we executed before from a "standalone" Jenkins X YAML pipeline. This means, as mentioned before, that we are not using any Jenkins X `Build Packs`.

If we clone the same [petclinic-kaniko repo](https://github.com/dcanadillas/petclinic-kaniko) into a local directory `petclinic-jenkins-x` we can do the following (working from local):

- Deleting any Git repo reference from the local cloned directory with `rm -r ./.git*` so we are working for sure from a local copy
- Create in the local directory the following `jenkins-x.yml` file that simulates de `maven-build`, `kaniko-build` and `kubectl-deploy` tasks from our previous Tekton example (for simplicity we are not adding the step used before to check deployment):
  
  ```yaml
  buildPack: none
  pipelineConfig:
    pipelines:
      release:
        pipeline:
          stages:
            - name: Maven Build
              agent:
                image: maven
              steps:
                - command: mvn
                  args:
                    - clean
                    - install
            - name: Kaniko Build
              agent:
                image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:latest
              steps:
                - command: /kaniko/executor
                  args:
                    - "--dockerfile=Dockerfile"
                    - "--context=/workspace/source"
                    - "--destination=eu.gcr.io/emea-sa-demo/petclinic-kaniko:latest"
            - name: Kubectl Deploy 
              agent:
                image: gcr.io/cloud-builders/kubectl:latest
              steps:
                - command: kubectl
                  args:
                    - apply
                    - -f
                    - https://github.com/dcanadillas/petclinic-kaniko-deploy/blob/master/test-deploy.yaml?raw=true
                    - -n
                    - jx-staging
  ```

- Import the project with Jenkins X from the local directory:
  
  ```bash
  $ jx import --git-username dcanadillas --org jx-dcanadillas --name petclinic-jenkins-x -m YAML
  [...]
  ? Git user name: dcanadillas
  The directory /Users/david/Documents/Workspace/Technologists/petclinic-kaniko is not yet using git
  ? Would you like to initialise git now? Yes
  ? Commit message:  Initial import
  [...]
  ? Using organisation: jx-dcanadillas
  ? Enter the new repository name:  petclinic-jenkins-x
  [...]
  ```

*NOTE: We could have imported first the project and then changed the `jenkins-x.yml`. In that case Jenkins X would have detected to apply a Maven `Build Pack` doing the first run with it. But I wanted to force Jenkins X to not recognize any `Build Pack` from the beggining, so there is no pipeline execution different than the one we want to simulate.*

Then the first pipeline execution is automatically run, because Jenkins X creates the GitHub repo with its webhook for you. The status of the execution can be seen by:

```bash
$ jx get activity -f petclinic -w

```

As we can see in the activity logs, three stages are executed, which are corresponding to their Tekton `Tasks`. If we search for Tekton components, we can check that everything is created by Jenkins X for the Tekton engine execution:

```bash
$ kubectl get tasks,tasks,taskruns,pipeline,pipelineruns
NAME                                                                      AGE
task.tekton.dev/jx-dcanadillas-petclinic-jenkin-rhg88-kaniko-build-2      7m

task.tekton.dev/jx-dcanadillas-petclinic-jenkin-rhg88-maven-build-2       7m

taskrun.tekton.dev/jx-dcanadillas-petclinic-jenkin-rhg88-2-maven-build-d42f4       7m

NAME                                                          AGE
pipeline.tekton.dev/jx-dcanadillas-petclinic-jenkin-rhg88-2   7m

NAME                                                             AGE
pipelinerun.tekton.dev/jx-dcanadillas-petclinic-jenkin-rhg88-2   7m
```

There they are. The same components that were created "manually" in our previous Tekton example. Truth is that `Tasks` configurations in this case use more parameters inside (`DOCKER_REGISTRY`, `REPO_OWNER`, `PIPELINE_KIND`, `BUILD_NUMBER`, `APP_NAME`, `VERSION`... and more) that are configured by Jenkins X. But that is the thing. Just because Jenkins X is orchestrating the pipeline execution from a simpler definition it's abstracting some configurations for you and using some parameters to make it easier.

If we check the pods used by the pipeline execution we will find again three of them (one pod per Tekton task):

```bash
$ kubectl get pod -n jx
NAME                                                                      READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

```

And we can check that same application has been deployed in the namespace `jx-staging`:

```bash
$ kubectl get svc petclinic-service -n jx-staging
NAME                TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)          AGE

```

![Petclinic deployed with JX pipeline](/img/tekton-jx-orchestration/petclinic-jx_pipeline.png)

We can conclude about the following about simulating the same Tekton configuration with Jenkins X Pipelines:

- CI/CD pipeline was designed in one YAML file of a couple of lines, instead of defining several YAML files with cross-reference definitions (we could have defined one YAML file for the Tekton example, but would have been very big file with lots of lines of code and not very manageable).
- Jenkins X, from that monilithic simple definition, creates automatically all Tekton decoupled components (`Tasks`, `Pipeline`, `PipelineResources`, `PipelineRuns`, etc.).
- There is **no need to define any secret or serviceAccount**. Jenkins X configures the platform parameters automatically when installing, passing those parameters to the pipeline Tekton components at execution creation. You can also change default parameters in the pipeline with an easy commang line execution `jx create variable`, or just adding them in the YAML file.
- It is much easier to create a Jenkins X pipeline to orchestrate Tekton components than creating the isolated components by itself and then deploying the execution.
- All GitHub "dirty work" like webhooks, credentials or updates required are already configured by Jenkins X to work only on code changes.
- We could see also that pipeline execution is faster because Jenkins X takes care about artifact caching and optimizing Kubernetes resources used.

Let's use the following diagram to show how a Jenkins X pipeline definition is translated into Tekton components, like also happened in our example:

![Jenkins X Pipelines to Tekton](/img/tekton-jx-orchestration/jxpipeline-to-tekton.png)

### The pure Jenkins X way

But let's be honest. If we want to take advantadge of a real pipeline orchestration platform like Jenkins X, previous configuration of `jenkins-x.yml` is not the best way to go. That was intended to understand how a Jenkins X pipeline definition is abstracting Tekton components to run CI/CD pipelines.

The real value of a CI/CD pipeline orchestration platform is about something else than abstracting a powerful decoupled CI/CD engine like Tekton. So let's try to understand what I am talking about by doing CI/CD with the same [petclinic-kaniko repo](https://github.com/dcanadillas/petclinic-kaniko) in a *pure Jenkins X way* using Jenkins X build packs.

As shown before, for demonstration purposes I am cloning first the original repo and then importing from local to to automatically create from Jenkins X a new repo in GitHub. I could import directly from the GitHub repo, creating then a new commit with the changes to continue to do CI/CD with Jenkins X (for example changing my old `Jenkinsfile` for a new `jenkins-x.yaml`).

Because I don't want to change the [original repo](https://github.com/dcanadillas/petclinic-kaniko), let's do the following:

- Clone original repo from the terminal with `git clone https://github.com/dcanadillas/petclinic-kaniko petclinic-jx`.
- Remove git references `rm -rf petclinic-jx/.git*`.
- Now, create Jenkins X project by importing from the local repo into a new GitHub repository:
  
  ```bash
  jx import --git-username dcanadillas --org jx-dcanadillas --name petclinic-jx -m YAML
  ```

Note that we are using `-m YAML` to force Jenkins X creating a new Jenkins X serverless pipeline project instead of a Static `Jenkinsfile` one.

Different things are going on when importing the project with Jenkins X:

- Creates a local git repo (similar to `git init`).
- Selects a [Draft](https://draft.sh/) build pack from Jenkins X. (*In this case takes a [maven build pack](https://github.com/jenkins-x-buildpacks/jenkins-x-kubernetes/tree/master/packs/maven)*).
- Pushes the new repository with changes applied from the build pack to a repo in the GitHub organization specified in the `--org` parameter.
- Creates a GitHub webhook for Jenkins X to be able to trigger pipelines automatically with any code change.
- Runs the pipeline to build the application and promotes to Staging using GitOps.

Basically, Jenkins X already configured the CI/CD pipeline just by importing the project. So now there is already a pipeline running. All steps executed by the pipeline build can be seen with `jx get activity -f petclinic-jx -w` . Once it succeeded:

```bash
$ jx get activity -f petclinic-jx --build 1

The pipeline created by Jenkins X has just two Tekton tasks with different steps. The first Tekton task from build pack and a second task `Promote: Staging`. This just comes from the pipeline defined by Jenkins X:

```bash
$ cat jenkins-x.yml
buildPack: maven
```

It's a **one line pipeline** that it's just "inheriting" from the [maven build pack pipeline](https://github.com/jenkins-x-buildpacks/jenkins-x-kubernetes/blob/master/packs/maven/pipeline.yaml).

Bottom line here is that build packs are templates for building your application. So developers don't need to think about how to conceptually design the CI/CD pipelines, or components needed to manage Kubernetes in order to promote the application. But you can extend using the `jenkins-x.yaml` or by executing `jx create step` command. In this case Jenkins X already propose a [pipeline lifecycle](https://jenkins-x.io/architecture/build-packs/#lifecycles), that it is translated on how Tekton decouples the pipeline execution objects.

Coming back to our execution, the application is just automatically deployed and versioned into the `Staging` environment at version `0.0.1`:

```bash
$ jx get version
APPLICATION      STAGING PODS URL
petclinic                1/1
petclinic-jx     0.0.1        http://petclinic-jx.jx-staging.cbjx.dcanadillas.com
```

In this output we can see also our previous `petclinic` application deployed with our previous example  with the "customized" Jenkins X pipeline. And our recently deployed Jenkins X application `petclinic-jx`. Some differences between them are that we needed to define deployment in the first pipeline example (non-pure Jenkins X way), but there is no versioning or promotion lifecycle. In the other hand, our last application build - just by importing it with Jenkins X - it is versioned, deployed in the right environment and with an access url. This means that the Kubernetes `service`, `deployyment` and `ingress` have been configured automatically. And it also used GitOps promotion to track and audit all versioning and promotion environment.

But, the last application deployment wasn't really successful:

```bash
$ jx open petclinic-jx -n jx-staging
petclinic-jx: http://petclinic-jx.jx-staging.cbjx.dcanadillas.com
```

We get a `503` error from the application.

If we check what is going on:

```bash

When the project was imported from Jenkins X and the build pack was applied, some components were added to the original project. Like`helm charts` required to deploy and promote through environments.
Looking at previous error logs in the `Pod`, the problem seems to be about changing the `probePath` in the file `petclinic-jx/charts/petclinic-jx/values.yaml`. Let's fix it. We need to change it from `/actuator/health` to `/`:

```bash
cat charts/petclinic-jx/values.yaml | sed 's/\/actuator\/health/\//g' | tee charts/petclinic-jx/values.yaml
```

Then, we apply the changes to the repo and the pipeline will be triggered automatically:

```bash
$ git commit -am "probePath changed to the right value"
$ git push -u origin master
[...]
To https://github.com/jx-dcanadillas/petclinic-jx.git
   b25d36b..234b99a  master -> master
Rama 'master' configurada para hacer seguimiento a la rama remota 'master' de 'origin'.
```

The pipeline should start running againg to build the application and promote version `0.0.2` into `Staging`.

```bash
$ jx get activity -f petclinic-jx -w

Checking then that the new version `0.0.2` is deployed:

```bash
$ jx get version
APPLICATION      STAGING PODS URL
petclinic                1/1
petclinic-jx     0.0.2   1/1  http://petclinic-jx.jx-staging.cbjx.dcanadillas.com
```

And opening the new version:

```bash
$ jx open petclinic-jx -n jx-staging
```
![Petclinic deployed](/img/tekton-jx-orchestration/petclinic-jx_staging.png)

The pure Jenkins X way is about:

- Applying build pack for adopting pipeline definition experience best practices
- Complete pipeline orchestration for build and promote using Tekton native objects
- GitOps for promotion process
- Kubernetes objects management required for pipeline execution
- Pipeline extensions using easy pipeline definition with `jenkins-x.yml`

It is a simpler and more complete experience of CI/CD pipelines than trying to deal with Tekton itself. It is a real orchestration of all resources to develop, build and promote from real cloud native environment.

And last, to demonstrate that all Tekton orchestration happened, let's check all components created for all our Jenkins X executions:

## Some thoughts and final conclusions

[Traditional Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) has long been one of the best CI/CD pipeline engines in terms of flexibility, standardization and adoption for most DevOps environments. But new challenges for software delivery requires scalable CI/CD architectures. Today that means using Kubernetes as a powerful abstraction of the infrastructure and the use of cloud native platforms to decouple and scale CI/CD pipelines.

Decoupling and scaling pipelines is one of the best approaches for building new modern applications and microservices. But it can be very hard to work on these decoupled objects to define a pipeline, which conceptually is a sequential and "monolithic" tasks execution.

So, Tekton is demonstrating its power of decoupling CI/CD pipelines and builds to scale. But it also needs a powerful orchestrator to simplify the complexity underneath, and even more when dealing with a platform like Kubernetes, that can also add more complexity.

I like to say that the best way to build and run CI/CD pipelines for modern (and also traditional, why not!) software applications is to make it simple and "abstract the abstraction". I believe Jenkins X is about that. It is about applying the simplicity of trational Jenkins pipelines from a powerful and scalable engine.

Most development companies are realizing that CI/CD next iteration is already here and that it's not only about cloud native pipelines, YAML object definintions or Kubernetes containers orchestration. It is about orchestrating all the complexity while adopting best practices. We are talking about build packs templating, simple YAML pipelines, seamless Git integration, scalable team management, flexible and standard deployments, extensible platform engine, standard packaging and promotion, etc.

We've seen from a very basic point of view in our examples what it means to orchestrate this. And ... it is more than Tekton on steroids.
